The checklist helps in providing a guideline to see whether or not a repository is good for new contributors. However, I feel like this process is too much work to define whether a repository is good or not. To be honest, as long as it has a contributions tab that explains what is needed and how it should be implemented, I dont see why the amount of open issues or whether it is recent or not is going to help me. Logically speaking, if the contributions are too difficult for me to implement, it doesnt really matter if all of the other tabs are checked off. Although the links were useful in showing me the size of the open source community, it did not help me narrow down my choices.  

Having a moderator assist me in the git activity made it all the much easier and clearer to understand. The steps provided a clear step by step case that told us what to do, but it was the moderator that explained the little questions I had. I had a slight confusion on what origin and master was referring to, and my moderator explained to me that all repositories are naturally called master, but origin refers to your fork. *I actually pulled up the slide with the images while I was doing my work and the visuals were what helped me understand the material that much more.*
